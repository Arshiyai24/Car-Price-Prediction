# TASK 2🚗 Car Price Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview

Predicting car prices is a common and useful application of machine learning. Car prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as brand value, mileage, horsepower, engine capacity, and additional features. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on its specifications and attributes.

- Understand the key factors that influence car prices.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for better model performance.
- Apply various regression models to predict car prices.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Visualize data and results to gain insights.

## 🧠 What I Learn

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, feature scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training
- Regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features like:
- Car Name / Brand
- Model Year
- Mileage
- Engine Capacity
- Horsepower
- Transmission Type
- Fuel Type
- Number of Seats
- Price (Target Variable)
